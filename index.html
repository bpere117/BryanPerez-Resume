        Bryan Perez is currently a student at the University of California, Riverside working towards earning his Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Management. Perez has had a long history of academic excellence, but his achievements are not only limited to the classroom. Perez participated in his high schoolâ€™s Varsity Soccer team from grades 9 through 11 and used his passion for the sport to co-run a soccer league with his father, LA Alhambra Soccer League. From the age of 13, he has been helping his father with the labor side of working in the soccer league, such as painting fields and putting up goals. However, as Perez grew older he began to play a more important role in the league and would eventually co-manage the entire league with his father. Perez has had various roles within the soccer league that ranged from designing banners and social media profiles to creating an online registration system during the pandemic when in-person interaction was limited. Perez has also taken on the role of being a coach to two soccer teams that participate in the league and has developed key leadership skills that helped him lead his teams to championship games.<br><br>

        In addition to running the soccer league, Perez created a temporary small delivery business, BCAP Express, during his Senior year of high school in which he would deliver locally for small companies as an alternative to UPS or FedEx. Initially he was delivering for multiple clients every once in a while, but he eventually acquired a dental supply company that agreed to send all of their local orders with him. Perez would be delivering between 40-150 boxes to 20-60 different dental offices all around Southern California every day after he finished with his online classes. Perez did not own a delivery van so he used his fatherâ€™s GMC Yukon in order to fit the heavy load of boxes that the dental supply company would give. After finishing his deliveries during the day, he would use the evenings to create an invoice for the dayâ€™s deliveries and then visit the dental supply warehouse to pick up the orders that would be delivered the next day. Once Perez obtained and organized all the orders he would design the delivery route that he would follow using a route optimization software known as Route4Me.<br><br>

        Through Perezâ€™s experience in these ventures, he has gained lots of exposure to and was able to become proficient in several different software programs. For example, Perez created an informational website using Google Sites where participants of the soccer league can view the leaderboards for every division, which are updated weekly. He created a registration system for participants using Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Google Drive. Perez used Adobe Photoshop to design banners in order to promote and market the league. He uses Bodno, an ID card software, in order to create and print IDâ€™s for the participants in the league. Perez also used Google Sheets to create invoices for his delivery business and Route4Me to design the routes that he used while working. Perez is also proficient in Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Access.<br><br>
